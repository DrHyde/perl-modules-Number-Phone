This distribution contains several modules.

To install them modules, do the usual dance:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Number::Phone is a base class for parsing and dealing with phone numbers.

Number::Phone::UK inherits methods from it, over-riding some with UK-
specific implementations.  The intention is that other people will write
other country-specific classes exposing the same API.

Number::Phone::Country is a useful module which is used by the NANP modules.
It was originally written by T. J. Mather but is now maintained by me.

Number::Phone::StubCountry::* are automatically generated from Google's
libphonenumber project's data.  They do not support all the features of
Number::Phone, but will support many use-cases and should "fail
gracefully" if you try to use unsupported features.

Number::Phone::NANP implements functionality common to all NANP countries.

Please note that the build-data.* files are not intended for normal users to use. They are used by developers to re-build some of the internal databases inside the distribution. They have lots of extra dependencies that aren't needed once you've built the distribution.

The data used in these modules have come from all sorts of places.  Most
of them disclaim any responsibility for errors in the data.  I disclaim
all responsibility for errors too, even if my code makes your PBX turn
purple.

Data sources used include:
  WTNG:
    http://wtng.info/ - treat this with caution, it seems to be no
      longer maintained

  various telcos and regulatory bodies:
    http://www.itu.int/itu-t/inr/nnp/
    http://www.ofcom.org.uk/ - for UK data
    http://www.cnac.ca/ - for Canadian data
    https://www.nationalpooling.com - for US data

You can find the most recent version of the source code on Github at:

There is an online demo of some of its functionality here:

The most important bits of doco to read are Number::Phone,
Number::Phone::Country, Number::Phone::UK, and
Number::Phone::NANP.  Most other stuff is either a subclass of one
of those that provides country-specific data, or is a "helper"
module that supplies data in a non-user-oriented format, intended
only for internal use.
