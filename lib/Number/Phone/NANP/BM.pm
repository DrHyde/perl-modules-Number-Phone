=head1 NAME

Number::Phone::NANP::BM - BM-specific methods for Number::Phone

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements BM-specific methods for Number::Phone.  It is
a subclass of Number::Phone::NANP, which is in turn a subclass of
Number::Phone.  Number::Phone::NANP sits in the middle because all
NANP countries can share some significant chunks of code.  You should
never need to C<use> this module directly, as C<Number::Phone::NANP>
will load it automatically when needed.

    my $phone_number = Number::Phone->new('+1 441 292 4595');
    # returns a Number::Phone::NANP::BM object
