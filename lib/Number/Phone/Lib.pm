=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Number::Phone::Lib;

    $daves_phone = Number::Phone::lib->new('+442087712924');
    $daves_other_phone = Number::Phone::Lib->new('+44 7979 866 975');
    # alternatively      Number::Phone::Lib->new('+44', '7979 866 975');
    # or                 Number::Phone::Lib->new('UK', '07979 866 975');

    if ( $daves_phone->is_mobile() ) {
        send_rude_SMS();
    }

This subclass of Number::Phone exclusively uses classes generated from
Google's L<libphonenumber project|https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/>.
libphonenumber doesn't have enough data to support all the features of
Number::Phone, but you might want to use its data and no other for a few
reasons:

=over

=item *

Compatability with libphonenumber's Java, C++, and JavaScript implementations.

=item *

Performance. UK Number parsing and validation by Number::Phone::UK, in particular,
has a substantial overhead thanks to its embedded database. If all you need is
simple validation and/or formatting, all that overhead is unnecessary.

=back

That said, the core Number::Phone UK and NANP (North American Numbering Plan)
modules, in particular, are far more comprehensive. So use them if you need
them.

=head1 LICENCE

You may use, modify and distribute this software under the same terms as
perl itself.
