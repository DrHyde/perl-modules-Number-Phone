=head1 NAME

Number::Phone::Lib - Instantiate Number::Phone::* objects from libphonenumber

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Number::Phone::Lib;

    $daves_phone = Number::Phone::Lib->new('+442087712924');
    $daves_other_phone = Number::Phone::Lib->new('+44 7979 866 975');
    # alternatively      Number::Phone::Lib->new('+44', '7979 866 975');
    # or                 Number::Phone::Lib->new('UK', '07979 866 975');

    if ( $daves_phone->is_mobile() ) {
        send_rude_SMS();
    }

This subclass of L<Number::Phone> is used in exactly the same way as the normal
Number::Phone, but it exclusively uses classes generated from Google's
L<libphonenumber project|https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/>.
libphonenumber doesn't have enough data to support all the features of
Number::Phone, but you might want to use its data and no other for a few
reasons:

=item *

Compatibility with libphonenumber's Java, C++, and JavaScript implementations.

=item *

Performance. UK Number parsing and validation by Number::Phone::UK, in particular,
has a substantial overhead thanks to its embedded database. If all you need is
simple validation and/or formatting, all that overhead is unnecessary.

=back

That said, the core Number::Phone UK module
is far more comprehensive.

=head1 METHODS

There is one method, a constructor:

=head2 new

Call this in exactly the same way as you would call C<Number::Phone->new()>. The
only difference is that you will get stubs back instead of "full-fat" objects,
even if full-fat classes are available.

=head1 LICENCE

You may use, modify and distribute this software under the same terms as
perl itself.
