- Number::Phone::Country no longer exports 'phone2country', after this
  being deprecated for 20 years!

- the 'noexport' flag on Number::Phone::Country now results in a warning
  which will become fatal 2 years after this release. At the same time,
  warnings about unknown flags will also become fatal.

4.0003    2024-06-07

- No longer auto-tested on 5.12 and below because build-time dependencies
  no longer build reliably

- Data updates, including Lithuania changing its trunk prefix, Mexico
  getting rid of theirs, and Uzbekistan changing both its trunk and
  international prefixes

- Trying to put letters in a phone number now emits warnings, and will
  become fatal 2 years after this release

4.0002    2024-03-08

- Added timezones() method

- Data updates

- Tests are now forgiving of a missing Parallel::ForkManager
  (which isn't available on some Solaris machines)

- Clarification in doco re supported perl versions

- Data updates

4.0000    2023-09-03

  less than 10% of its previous size.

- Data updates

3.9002    2023-06-14

- Data updates only

3.9001    2023-03-07

- Bug fix: if libphonenumber doesn't define any formatters for a country,
  such as for Bonaire (BQ), do the best we can and return +CC NNNNN
  instead of nothing. This was a regression in 3.9000, see
  https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/122

3.9000    2023-03-05

- Add validation using libphonenumber's data for non-geographic country
  codes like +800 (International free phone) and +870 (Inmarsat). See
  https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/17

- Bug fix: NANP toll-free numbers corrected. 833 area code now supported,
  and regex fixed to only match when the B and C digits are the same, so
  800 is toll-free, 888 is toll-free, but 808 is not. See
  https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/110

- Bug fix: NANP 1-600 area code is non-geographic. See
  https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/113

- Workaround: OFCOM have the wrong number length for the +44 800 716 range,
  we now have an egregious hack to work around that. See
  https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/112

- No longer auto-tested on 5.10 because a 'make test'-time dependency (Test::Deep)
  no longer supports that.

- Fix Makefile.PL to not consume arguments that my code doesn't know about but
  which are relevant to EU::MM (https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/pull/106)

- Explicitly open databases read-only so it works on a RO filesystem
  (https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/107)

3.8001    2021-09-21

- Tweak build to use more compatible options to tar(1) so some really old tars
  can read the archive correctly

3.8000    2021-09-19

- Bugfix for numbers in local format which may be ambiguous for UK Crown Dependencies
  when using Number::Phone::Lib

- Bugfix for when you ask for an object representing a number in one country
  but provide a number for a different country. This mostly affects countries
  that contain other jurisdictions squatting on parts of their number plan,
  such as the Vatican in the Italian plan, and the Crown Dependencies in the UK
  plan. It is now an error to ask for an object representing a number in a
  'sub-country' which isn't valid in that sub-country (eg asking for a Jersey
  object but passing a Guernsey number); but if you ask for an object representing
  the 'super-country' but pass a 'sub-country' number you'll still get an object
  representing the sub-country. ie, say "gimme a GB object for this 'ere Guernsey number"
  and you'll get a Guernsey object.

                          instead of valid but unallocated (fix arising from
                          https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/98);
                        Use data from a tagged release of libphonenumber instead of whatever
                          is in master, so builds are more reproducible, and expose that
                          tag in libphonenumber_tag method;
                        Expose OFCOM, CNAC, NPA and localcallingguide.com data update

2018-04-10      3.4004  We now have some data from libphonenumber for Kosovo
                          (see https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/66);
                        Kosovo has migrated to +383 so get rid of the special cases in +377 etc;

                        UK data can be slurped into memory for faster access (but slow startup);
                        Data updates

2017-07-02      3.4001  Added some nominally redundant dependencies (see
                          https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/pull/68);
                        UK "protected" numbers are now included;

                        +383 (Kosovo) is now a special-case for validation

                        NANP modules now know about is_tollfree, is_specialrate and
                          is_personal;
                        Number::Phone::Country will now warn that exporting is deprecated;
                        Stubs and dial_to are no longer experimental;
                        Minor doco improvements, including some from the Debian project

                          code paths;
                        More comprehensive testing of stubs, and resulting bug-fixes for
                          territories that appear as part of another's number plan, such
                          as enormous Kazakhstan and tiny Tristan da Cunha;

2016-06-05      3.2000  Bump version number because rpm is stupid and thinks
                          3.1 < 3.0014;
                        Recognize Isle of Man (IM) free/special-rate

                          Schout for the suggestion;
                        Data updates

2015-12-08      3.0014  Deprecated APIs of being able to call most methods as
                          class methods or functions instead of object methods
                          have now been deleted;
                        Remove unnecessary N::P::NANP->country method - the
                          implementation in the superclass is sufficient;
                        Data updates

2015-11-04      3.0013  Fix another bug in the tests which threw up

                        Fix broken code for is_specialrate in stubs,
                          which previously always returned undef (ie
                          unknown) even when libphonenumber knew it was
                          eg premium rate (bug found by Gerhard Poul's
                          PR 46);
                        +44 3 numbers have is_specialrate set;
                        Fix bug where Number::Phone::Country would get
                          re-set to 'UK' mode instead of the ISO-ly

2015-03-13      3.0007  Mostly just updated data from Google and OFCOM;
                        Announced approximately quarterly release schedule

2014-12-03      3.0006  Updated country codes and access codes for some
                          French overseas departments and ex-Soviet countries;
                        Fix bug confusing Georgia (GE) and South Georgia (GS);

2014-11-25      3.0005  Bugfix for stubs of countries with no national dialing
                          code.

2014-11-24      3.0004  Mailing list for users created;
                        Bugfixes for Curacao, Svalbard;
                        Bugfixes for stubs of countries where numbers can
                          begin with the national dialling prefix, eg Russia,
                          where the prefix is 8 but area codes like 812 exist;
                        New UK allocations

2014-09-04      3.0003  Bugfix: N::P->new("CC", 0...") now works
                          (where 0 is the national dialling prefix);
                        New UK allocations

2014-08-22      3.0002  Be more consistent when formatting UK numbers
                          for which we have incomplete data from OFCOM,,
                          no matter how they're instantiated;
                        New UK allocations

2014-06-17      3.0001  Make N::P::UK->format() cope better when OFCOM
                          don't tell us how long 08 numbers are;
                        New UK allocations

2014-04-25      3.0     Add Number::Phone::Lib, a libphonenumber-compatible
                          subclass. This lacks some functionality but is
                          considerably faster (for UK numbers) and compatible
                          (for non-geographic NANP numbers);
                        Add some new CA/US area codes;
                        Add more GMSS codes;
                        Use libphonenumber data for some NANP countries (some
                          have dodgy data*) for is_mobile, is_fixed_line

* Some countries have duplicate regexes for fixed_line/mobile in libphonenumber,
  and others have regexes that match the same data

2014-04-15      2.2003  Bugfix to tighten up length checking for

                          return DE" is obviously wrong;
                        Some stuff in stubs for the breakup of the
                          Dutch colonies in the Caribbean;
                        New UK allocations;

                        The minimal objects returned when there's no detailed
                          country-specific module available are far more
                          intelligent, thanks to libphonenumber's data;

                          Western Sahara number ranges identified;
                          Kosovo (no ISO3166 country code yet, so I'm

2010-09-12      1.8     INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: constructor will now return
                          a minimal object instead of undef if there's no

                        Removed docs from N::P::UK::DBM::Deep and

2006-08-25      1.55    Damnit, 1.54's ...UK->location() was wrong
2006-08-24      1.54    And again!
2006-08-23      1.53    Doh!  How we loaded location data was buggy
2006-08-23      1.52    Documentation patches;
                        Corrected CHANGELOG entry for v1.51;
                        Added location data for the UK
2006-08-22      1.51    Updated UK data to access DATA filehandle directly,
                          which depends on DBM::Deep 0.97 and above.  This
                          saves even more memory and makes the module load
                          a lot faster;
                        New UK allocations;
                        Some improvements and fixes in OFCOM data parser;
                        Bug fixes :-( for UK numbers with a significant F digit
2005-10-16      1.5     UK data moved into an embedded DBM::Deep structure
                          to save memory (NB: this adds dependencies)
                        Added location() method
2005-10-11      1.4004  New UK allocations
                        Removed 'use warnings' and 'use diagnostics' because
                          they pointlessly require a later version of perl;
                        re the above, tests now all use -w instead
2005-08-23      1.4003  Updated N::P::Country to use CS instead of YU for
                          Yugoslavia (ISO 3166 has been updated)
                        Fixed non-US and non-CA countries in N::P::Country's
                          phone2country_and_idd function (BUGFIX)

2005-05-18      1.4     updated Number::Phone::Country to remove American
                          Samoa's +684 code, it has migrated to +1 684 in
                          the NANP
                        N::P::C now correctly identifies US numbers
                          doesn't just assume a NANP number is US if it's
                          not assigned to another country
                        N::P::C no longer uses <DATA>
                        N::P::C added missing countries
                        some tidying in N::P::C's tests
                        N::P->country now defaults to returning current country
                        some tidying in N::P base class
                        new UK number allocations
                        UK data file now has version number (autogen from date)
                        UK data fixed for numbers "Allocated for Migration only"
                        Added NANP class and NANP::XX subclasses
2005-04-12      1.3004  new UK number allocations
                        removed 'use diagnostics'
2004-12-05      1.3003  new UK number allocations
2004-11-26      1.3002  OFCOM's UK data had some spurious spaces in numeric
                          fields, which broke some 070 numbers, these are now
                          filtered out
2004-11-10      1.3001  new UK number allocations
2004-10-20      1.3     Added note about number portability in UK module.
                        Added areaname() method to interface definition
                          and an implementation in the UK module.
                        Defined translates_to() method in superclass.
                        Added Number::Phone::Country to distribution.  This
                          was previously maintained by T.J.Mather.
2004-10-13      1.2001  No code changes, just new UK number allocations
2004-09-22      1.2     Oops, forgot to add is_ipphone to docs for N::P::UK
                          last time.
                        Updated N::P::UK::Data with some new number ranges.
2004-09-15      1.1     Number::Phone::UK now implements is_ipphone, and
                          N::P::UK::Data has appropriate data in it, as
                          OFCOM have this week publishedthe allocations they
                          made a few weeks ago.
                        Removed is_voip() alias, it didn't work properly
                          under all the possible ways of invoking it.
