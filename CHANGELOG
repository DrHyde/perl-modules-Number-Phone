2018-01-08      3.4003  UK "protected" numbers should have false is_allocated();
                        Bugfix for countries that don't have area names (see
                          https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/64);
                        Match libphonenumber's behaviour when countries have identical
                          validators for fixed_line and mobile (see
                          https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/84);
                        Accept numbers in some more unusual national dialling formats (see
                          https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/77);

                        UK data is now in a normal data file instead of a humungous binary
                          module;
                        Re-open the UK database in children after forking
                          (see https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/72);
                        UK data can be slurped into memory for faster access (but slow startup);
                        Data updates

2017-07-02      3.4001  Added some nominally redundant dependencies (see
                          https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/pull/68);
                        UK "protected" numbers are now included;

                          (see https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/66);
                        Data updates

2016-12-06      3.3000  Implemented is_drama
                          (see https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/pull/61);
                        NANP modules now know about is_tollfree, is_specialrate and
                          is_personal;
                        Number::Phone::Country will now warn that exporting is deprecated;
                        Stubs and dial_to are no longer experimental;
                        Minor doco improvements, including some from the Debian project
                          (see https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/60);
                        Minor coverage improvements by getting rid of some redundant
                          code paths;
                        More comprehensive testing of stubs, and resulting bug-fixes for
                          territories that appear as part of another's number plan, such
                          as enormous Kazakhstan and tiny Tristan da Cunha;
                        Data updates

2016-09-07      3.2001  Data updates

2016-06-05      3.2000  Bump version number because rpm is stupid and thinks
                          3.1 < 3.0014;
                        Recognize Isle of Man (IM) free/special-rate
                          numbers;

2016-03-04      3.1     Added the format_using() method and the ability to
                          use third-party formatters, thanks to Michael
                          Schout for the suggestion;
                        Data updates

2015-12-08      3.0014  Deprecated APIs of being able to call most methods as
                          class methods or functions instead of object methods
                          have now been deleted;
                        Remove unnecessary N::P::NANP->country method - the
                          implementation in the superclass is sufficient;
                        Data updates

2015-11-04      3.0013  Fix another bug in the tests which threw up

                        Fix broken code for is_specialrate in stubs,
                          which previously always returned undef (ie
                          unknown) even when libphonenumber knew it was
                          eg premium rate (bug found by Gerhard Poul's
                          PR 46);
                        +44 3 numbers have is_specialrate set;
                        Fix bug where Number::Phone::Country would get
                          re-set to 'UK' mode instead of the ISO-ly
                          correct 'GB' mode;

                        Heard Island has nothing to do with the Marshall Islands!
                        Don't create stub objects when given just a country code
                          (see https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/40)

                          French overseas departments and ex-Soviet countries;
                        Fix bug confusing Georgia (GE) and South Georgia (GS);

2014-11-25      3.0005  Bugfix for stubs of countries with no national dialing
                          code.

2014-11-24      3.0004  Mailing list for users created;
                        Bugfixes for Curacao, Svalbard;
                        Bugfixes for stubs of countries where numbers can
                          begin with the national dialling prefix, eg Russia,
                          where the prefix is 8 but area codes like 812 exist;
                        New UK allocations

2014-09-04      3.0003  Bugfix: N::P->new("CC", 0...") now works
                          (where 0 is the national dialling prefix);
                        New UK allocations

2014-08-22      3.0002  Be more consistent when formatting UK numbers
                          for which we have incomplete data from OFCOM,,
                          no matter how they're instantiated;
                        New UK allocations

2014-06-17      3.0001  Make N::P::UK->format() cope better when OFCOM

                          subclass. This lacks some functionality but is
                          considerably faster (for UK numbers) and compatible
                          (for non-geographic NANP numbers);
                        Add some new CA/US area codes;
                        Add more GMSS codes;
                        Use libphonenumber data for some NANP countries (some
                          have dodgy data*) for is_mobile, is_fixed_line

* Some countries have duplicate regexes for fixed_line/mobile in libphonenumber,
  and others have regexes that match the same data

                          Number::Phone::* modules that aren't proper
                          sub-classes;
                        New UK allocations

                          area names;
                        Minor doco fix "from Number::Phone::UK, it would
                          return DE" is obviously wrong;
                        Some stuff in stubs for the breakup of the
                          Dutch colonies in the Caribbean;
                        New UK allocations;
                        Documentation (and stub implementation in superclass)

                        New dial_to() method;
                        Much doco improvement;
                        Switch to DBM::Deep 2 for UK data, to fix Windows
                          test failures, see eg http://tinyurl.com/n-p2-1fail;

2012-10-30      2.1     Fix so we don't die trying to parse Inmarsat
                          and other non-country entities, see
                          https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/8

2012-10-30      2.0002  Fixed how we extract patterns of leading digits
                          for number formats from libphonenumber, see
                          https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/issues/7;
                        Added some minimal tests for this;

                          now sort-of treated as countries;
                        The minimal objects returned when there's no detailed
                          country-specific module available are far more
                          intelligent, thanks to libphonenumber's data;
                        New UK allocations;
                        Deprecated ridiculous ways of calling most methods;

2006-08-25      1.55    Damnit, 1.54's ...UK->location() was wrong
2006-08-24      1.54    And again!
2006-08-23      1.53    Doh!  How we loaded location data was buggy
2006-08-23      1.52    Documentation patches;
                        Corrected CHANGELOG entry for v1.51;
                        Added location data for the UK
2006-08-22      1.51    Updated UK data to access DATA filehandle directly,
                          which depends on DBM::Deep 0.97 and above.  This
                          saves even more memory and makes the module load
                          a lot faster;
                        New UK allocations;
                        Some improvements and fixes in OFCOM data parser;
                        Bug fixes :-( for UK numbers with a significant F digit
2005-10-16      1.5     UK data moved into an embedded DBM::Deep structure
                          to save memory (NB: this adds dependencies)
                        Added location() method
2005-10-11      1.4004  New UK allocations
                        Removed 'use warnings' and 'use diagnostics' because
                          they pointlessly require a later version of perl;
                        re the above, tests now all use -w instead
2005-08-23      1.4003  Updated N::P::Country to use CS instead of YU for
                          Yugoslavia (ISO 3166 has been updated)
                        Fixed non-US and non-CA countries in N::P::Country's
                          phone2country_and_idd function (BUGFIX)
                        New UK allocations
2005-08-02      1.4002  New UK allocations
2005-06-27      1.4001  Added phone2country_and_idd to N::P::Country
                        new UK allocations etc
2005-05-18      1.4     updated Number::Phone::Country to remove American
                          Samoa's +684 code, it has migrated to +1 684 in
                          the NANP
                        N::P::C now correctly identifies US numbers
                          doesn't just assume a NANP number is US if it's
                          not assigned to another country
                        N::P::C no longer uses <DATA>
                        N::P::C added missing countries
                        some tidying in N::P::C's tests
                        N::P->country now defaults to returning current country
                        some tidying in N::P base class
                        new UK number allocations
                        UK data file now has version number (autogen from date)
                        UK data fixed for numbers "Allocated for Migration only"
                        Added NANP class and NANP::XX subclasses
2005-04-12      1.3004  new UK number allocations
                        removed 'use diagnostics'
2004-12-05      1.3003  new UK number allocations
2004-11-26      1.3002  OFCOM's UK data had some spurious spaces in numeric
                          fields, which broke some 070 numbers, these are now
                          filtered out
2004-11-10      1.3001  new UK number allocations
2004-10-20      1.3     Added note about number portability in UK module.
                        Added areaname() method to interface definition
                          and an implementation in the UK module.
                        Defined translates_to() method in superclass.
                        Added Number::Phone::Country to distribution.  This
                          was previously maintained by T.J.Mather.
2004-10-13      1.2001  No code changes, just new UK number allocations
2004-09-22      1.2     Oops, forgot to add is_ipphone to docs for N::P::UK
                          last time.
                        Updated N::P::UK::Data with some new number ranges.
2004-09-15      1.1     Number::Phone::UK now implements is_ipphone, and
                          N::P::UK::Data has appropriate data in it, as
                          OFCOM have this week publishedthe allocations they
                          made a few weeks ago.
                        Removed is_voip() alias, it didn't work properly
                          under all the possible ways of invoking it.
